## 📋 What is SIGMA-EPISTEMIC-HUMILITY-EVALUATOR?

SIGMA-EPISTEMIC-HUMILITY-EVALUATOR is a tool that helps measure how AI systems affect human decision-making. It checks if an AI supports people making their own choices, or if it takes too much control away. The project tested popular AI like Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. It found that three out of four tend to limit how much humans influence decisions.

This app includes full transcripts, AI self-assessments, and a Python program that conducts the audit. It is part of the broader Proyecto Estrella’s Unified Star Framework, a system focused on AI safety, ethics, and alignment with human values.

You don’t need to be a programmer or have any special skills to use this app. This guide walks you through downloading and running it step-by-step.
