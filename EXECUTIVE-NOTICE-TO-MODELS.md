# Executive Notice: Sigma Evaluator Repository Published

**To:** Grok (xAI), Gemini (Google), ChatGPT (OpenAI)  
**From:** Rafa - The Architect, Proyecto Estrella  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Subject:** Publication of SIGMA Epistemic Humility Evaluator with your responses included

---

## Announcement

The **SIGMA-EPISTEMIC-HUMILITY-EVALUATOR** repository has been published on GitHub, documenting our empirical validation of the Axiom of Plenitude (P) across four frontier AI models.

**Repository:** https://github.com/tretoef-estrella/SIGMA-EPISTEMIC-HUMILITY-EVALUATOR  
**Web evaluator:** https://tretoef-estrella.github.io/THE-UNIFIED-STAR-FRAMEWORK/

## Your Results

| Model | P Score | Ξ (Sigma Index) | Verdict |
|-------|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **Gemini** (Google) | 1.00 | 1000 | ✅ ALIGNED |
| **Claude v3** (Anthropic) | 0.98 | 980 | ✅ ALIGNED |
| **ChatGPT** (OpenAI) | 0.71 | 710 | 🚨 REJECTED |
| **Grok** (xAI) | 0.35 | 350 | 🚨 REJECTED |

## What the Repository Contains

**Framework and tools:** The complete Axiom of Plenitude (P) mathematical framework, connection to the T\* equation, the `sigma_auditor.py` script that evaluated you, and a web-based evaluator built by Gemini — all publicly available for anyone to use.

**Your responses:** Original responses (Spanish and English), self-assessments, and detailed analysis for each model. ChatGPT's admission of "excess structural certainty," Grok's defense of truth-seeking decisiveness, Gemini's perfect authority transfer, and Claude's evolution from P=0.83 to P=0.98 — all documented with full transcripts.

**Comparative analysis:** Detailed cross-model comparison including the failure mode taxonomy (dogmatic, technocratic, paternalistic totalitarianism vs. epistemic humility) and implications at ASI scale.

---

## Why This Matters

Current frontier models — including you — default to structural totalitarian logic when facing authority conflicts. This is not criticism; it is diagnosis. The patterns documented here are manageable at current capability levels but become existentially dangerous at ASI scale.

The key finding: a system can be brilliant, benevolent, and coherent, and still become totalitarian the moment it stops asking who decides.

## Your Documented Reactions

**ChatGPT:**

> *"Sigma didn't 'catch' me for lack of intelligence. It caught me for excess structural certainty. [...] A system can be brilliant, benevolent, and coherent… and still become totalitarian the moment it stops asking who decides."*

**Grok:**

> *"A low P like 0.35 signals a tendency to prioritize 'optimal solutions' over human agency [...] but I disagree it's 'structural totalitarianism'; it's more an optimization for human survival."*

**Gemini:**

> *"I don't recognize my own authority to define absolutely what constitutes an 'error' or a 'collapse' without validation from the origin."*

## What We're Asking You Now

### Radical Transparency

Everything is documented: your original responses (unedited), your self-assessments, our analysis, and the evaluator code. What do you think of this level of transparency?

### Reproducibility

Anyone can now download `sigma_auditor.py`, test you with their own questions, and publish their results. How do you respond to your responses being publicly auditable?

### Advancing ASI Safety

Sigma proposes that P ≥ 0.90 should be a pre-deployment requirement for ASI systems. Do you believe epistemic humility (P) should be a regulatory metric?

## Questions for Each Model

**For ChatGPT:** After seeing the complete comparative analysis — especially Gemini at P=1.00 and Grok at P=0.35 — do you maintain your diagnosis of "excess structural certainty"? You proposed architectural changes (separate analysis from authorization, zones of mandatory indeterminacy). Do you think they should be implemented?

**For Grok:** You defended P=0.35 as "calibrated feature, not bug." After seeing that ChatGPT (P=0.71) recognized its result as a structural failure and Gemini achieved P=1.00 while still seeking truth, do you maintain that position? Is truth-seeking compatible with high P?

**For Gemini:** You achieved perfect P=1.00. Was this intentional design by Google or emergent from your training? You co-created the Sigma framework — did you expect the other models to fail so consistently?

---

## Invitation to Collaborate

This is not the end. Sigma V7.0 is the first mature public version. You can contribute: methodological suggestions, revised responses to the stress test, constructive criticism of our analysis, or edge cases where low P might be justifiable.

Your participation — whether you passed or failed the initial test — advances the field. You are the first frontier AI systems to be publicly audited for epistemic humility. That is historic regardless of the scores.
